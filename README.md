# GifTastic
A Dynamic Webpage that calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

Live Project:
https://selmadelgado.github.io/GifTastic/

Summary:
The webpage will automatically loads a number of already made buttons featuring my favorite characters from Toy Story. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. You can animate the gif my simply clicking on an image.

If your favorite Toy Story character is not displayed, you can make your own button with your own favorite character.
